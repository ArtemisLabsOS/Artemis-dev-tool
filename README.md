# Artemis-dev-tool

Project Artemis is an Open Sourced client developer tool for single endpoint testing of GraphQL queries with Apollo Client. Query endpoint testing and cache management can be done in real time for instant engineering feedback without the need for backend resolvers.




Debug and test query mutations and calls using introspection






The web based extension is best used for React and Express products/applications in development mode, and is available at the chrome store. 

Core features:
1. Display schema, query, and GraphQL response with endpoint detection
2. Query caching and component storage- View normalized Apollo Client cache in JSON Format
3. History of past queries per testing session
4. Query response Snapshot feature
5. View Response and Query Visualizer tree in inspection window
6. Performance monitoring and Management
